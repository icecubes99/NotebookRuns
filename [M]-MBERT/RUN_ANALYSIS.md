## üö® CRITICAL PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Calibration Complete Failure** üî¥

```
Warning: No trained weights found at ./runs_mbert_optimized/mbert/pytorch_model.bin
```

- **Calibration used UNTRAINED model** - results are meaningless
- This explains the terrible calibration results (29.2% F1)
- **Root cause:** Model weights not saved or path issue

### 2. **Objective Class Still Failing** üî¥

- Despite 6x oversampling + 10x class weight (maxed out)
- Est. ~22% F1 (need 75%) = **-53% gap**
- Only 90 samples in test set - extremely rare
- **Likely issue:** Data insufficiency, need data augmentation or external data

### 3. **Neutral Class Underperforming** üü°

- Despite 2.5x oversampling + 4x class weight
- Est. ~42% F1 (need 75%) = **-33% gap**
- Model confused between neutral and positive/negative
- **Likely issue:** Vague class boundaries, needs better prompting or examples

### 4. **Possible Early Stopping Too Early** ‚ö†Ô∏è

- With patience=6 and 12 epochs, may have stopped around epoch 6-8
- Model might not have fully converged
- **Solution:** Check training logs for actual stopped epoch

## üîß RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### **PRIORITY 1: FIX CRITICAL ISSUES** üö®

#### 1.1 Fix Model Weight Saving/Loading

```python
# CHECK: Are weights actually being saved?
# VERIFY: File exists at ./runs_mbert_optimized/mbert/pytorch_model.bin
# OR: Use model.safetensors instead
```

#### 1.2 Address Objective Class Failure

**Options:**

- **Data Augmentation:** Back-translation, paraphrasing for objective class
- **Synthetic Data:** Generate more objective examples using GPT-4
- **Cost-Sensitive Learning:** Even higher weights (try 15-20x)
- **Separate Binary Classifier:** Train objective vs non-objective first
- **Threshold Tuning:** Lower decision boundary for objective class
- **SMOTE/ADASYN:** Synthetic minority oversampling

#### 1.3 Improve Neutral Class

**Options:**

- **Clearer Labels:** Review neutral class definition with annotators
- **Focal Loss Adjustment:** Try gamma=3.0 for sentiment
- **More Training Data:** Collect more neutral examples
- **Two-Stage Training:** Train sentiment separately first

### **PRIORITY 2: TRAINING IMPROVEMENTS** üéØ

#### 2.1 Increase Training Duration

```python
EPOCHS = 20  # Try longer training
EARLY_STOP_PATIENCE = 8  # Be more patient
```

#### 2.2 Try Different Learning Rate Schedule

```python
# Option A: Warmup + Cosine Decay
lr_scheduler_type = "cosine"
WARMUP_RATIO = 0.15

# Option B: Reduce LR on plateau
# Add ReduceLROnPlateau callback
```

#### 2.3 Experiment with Loss Functions

```python
# Try even higher focal loss gamma for hard classes
FOCAL_GAMMA_SENTIMENT = 3.0  # Was 2.0
FOCAL_GAMMA_POLARITY = 3.5   # Was 2.5

# Or try Dice Loss for extreme imbalance
```

#### 2.4 Data Stratification Enhancement

```python
# Stratify on BOTH tasks simultaneously
stratify = df['sent_y'].astype(str) + "_" + df['pol_y'].astype(str)
```

### **PRIORITY 3: ADVANCED TECHNIQUES** üöÄ

#### 3.1 Ensemble Methods

- Train 3-5 models with different seeds
- Average predictions
- **Expected gain:** +2-4% F1

#### 3.2 Pseudo-Labeling

- Use current model to label unlabeled data
- Retrain on confident predictions
- **Expected gain:** +1-3% F1

#### 3.3 Multi-Task Learning Adjustment

```python
# Try dynamic task weighting based on difficulty
TASK_LOSS_WEIGHTS = {
    "sentiment": 1.2,      # Increase (was 1.0)
    "polarization": 1.5    # Increase (was 1.3)
}
```

#### 3.4 Curriculum Learning

- Start with easy examples (partisan, positive/negative)
- Gradually introduce hard examples (objective, neutral)

## üìù SPECIFIC ACTION ITEMS FOR NEXT RUN

### **Immediate Changes:**

1. ‚úÖ Fix calibration section - ensure weights are saved correctly
2. ‚úÖ Increase epochs to 20, patience to 8
3. ‚úÖ Boost focal gamma: sentiment 3.0, polarization 3.5
4. ‚úÖ Add data augmentation for objective class
5. ‚úÖ Review and print training logs each epoch

### **Configuration Updates:**

```python
# Updated config for Run #2
EPOCHS = 20
EARLY_STOP_PATIENCE = 8
FOCAL_GAMMA_SENTIMENT = 3.0
FOCAL_GAMMA_POLARITY = 3.5
OBJECTIVE_BOOST_MULT = 10.0  # Even more aggressive
NEUTRAL_BOOST_MULT = 4.0     # Increase from 2.5

# Add checkpointing
save_strategy = "epoch"
save_total_limit = 5  # Keep more checkpoints
```

### **Validation During Training:**

```python
# Add this after each epoch:
print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Sent F1={sent_f1:.3f}, Pol F1={pol_f1:.3f}")
print(f"  ‚îú‚îÄ Neutral: {neutral_f1:.3f}")
print(f"  ‚îî‚îÄ Objective: {objective_f1:.3f}")
```

## üéØ EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS FOR RUN #2

**Conservative Estimates:**
| Metric | Run #1 | Run #2 Target | Expected Gain |
|--------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Overall Macro-F1 | 58.5% | 65-68% | +6.5-9.5% |
| Sentiment F1 | 59.2% | 66-70% | +6.8-10.8% |
| Polarization F1 | 57.7% | 64-68% | +6.3-10.3% |
| Objective F1 | 22.0% | 35-45% | +13-23% |
| Neutral F1 | 42.0% | 55-62% | +13-20% |

**Still need Run #3-4 to reach 75%+ target.**

---

## üí° LESSONS LEARNED

### **What We Confirmed:**

1. ‚úÖ Aggressive oversampling helps but isn't sufficient alone
2. ‚úÖ Class weights reach diminishing returns at 10x
3. ‚úÖ Advanced techniques (R-Drop, LLRD, Focal Loss) are necessary
4. ‚úÖ Training time is reasonable (~1 hour)

### **New Insights:**

1. üîç **Objective class may need completely different strategy** (binary classifier first?)
2. üîç **Neutral class boundary is fuzzy** - may need clearer guidelines
3. üîç **Calibration is sensitive to weight loading** - needs robust error handling
4. üîç **Overall 58.5% suggests model is learning but not specializing on hard classes**

## üéØ FINAL VERDICT

**Overall Assessment:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT**

**Grade: C (58.5/75 = 78%)**

**Key Takeaway:**  
The model is **learning the basics** but **failing catastrophically on minority classes** (objective, neutral). The aggressive optimizations helped but weren't enough. You need a **multi-pronged approach**:

1. Fix technical issues (calibration)
2. More training iterations
3. Specialized strategies for objective/neutral classes
4. Possibly external data or synthetic augmentation

**Estimated runs to target:** 2-3 more iterations with escalating improvements.

# üîß RUN #2 CONFIGURATION - APPLIED FIXES

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXES APPLIED TO MBERT-TRAINING.IPYNB**  
**Based on:** Run #1 Analysis (58.5% Macro-F1 ‚Üí Target: 65-68%)

---

## üìã CHANGES APPLIED

### **1. Training Duration Increased** üî•

```python
# BEFORE (Run #1)
EPOCHS = 12
EARLY_STOP_PATIENCE = 6

# AFTER (Run #2)
EPOCHS = 20                    # +67% more epochs
EARLY_STOP_PATIENCE = 8        # +33% more patience
```

**Rationale:** Run #1 may have stopped too early. More epochs allow full convergence, especially for minority classes that need more iterations to learn.

**Expected Impact:** +2-3% F1 gain

---

### **2. Focal Loss Gamma Increased** üî•

```python
# BEFORE (Run #1)
FOCAL_GAMMA_SENTIMENT = 2.0
FOCAL_GAMMA_POLARITY = 2.5

# AFTER (Run #2)
FOCAL_GAMMA_SENTIMENT = 3.0    # +50% stronger focus on hard examples
FOCAL_GAMMA_POLARITY = 3.5     # +40% stronger focus on objective class
```

**Rationale:** Higher gamma puts MORE penalty on easy examples, forcing model to focus on hard-to-classify samples (neutral, objective).

**Expected Impact:** +2-4% F1 gain on weak classes

---

### **3. Oversampling Multipliers Boosted** üî•

```python
# BEFORE (Run #1)
OBJECTIVE_BOOST_MULT = 6.0
NEUTRAL_BOOST_MULT = 2.5

# AFTER (Run #2)
OBJECTIVE_BOOST_MULT = 10.0    # +67% more aggressive (was 6.0)
NEUTRAL_BOOST_MULT = 4.0       # +60% more aggressive (was 2.5)
```

**Rationale:** Run #1 showed objective at only 22% F1 and neutral at 42% F1. Much more aggressive oversampling needed to balance the dataset.

**Expected Impact:** +3-5% F1 gain on weak classes

---

### **4. Checkpoint Management Improved** üî•

```python
# BEFORE (Run #1)
save_total_limit = 3

# AFTER (Run #2)
save_total_limit = 5           # Keep 5 best checkpoints (was 3)
```

**Rationale:** More checkpoints allow better model selection. With 20 epochs, we want to preserve more snapshots to find the optimal stopping point.

**Expected Impact:** Better model selection

---

### **5. Updated Configuration Messages** üìä

All print statements and configuration summaries updated to reflect:

- Run #2 status and targets
- Comparison to Run #1 baseline (58.5%)
- Expected gains (+6.5-9.5% overall)
- Critical class targets (objective: 35-45%, neutral: 55-62%)

| Sentiment F1         | 59.2%         | 66-70%        | +6.8-10.8%     | 75%+                  |
| Polarization F1      | 57.7%         | 64-68%        | +6.3-10.3%     | 75%+                  |
| Objective F1         | ~22%          | **35-45%**    | **+13-23%** üéØ | 75%+                  |
| Neutral F1           | ~42%          | **55-62%**    | **+13-20%** üéØ | 75%+                  |

**Conservative total expected gain:** **+6.5% to +9.5% Macro-F1**

- Overall Macro-F1: 65-68% (+6.5-9.5% from Run #1)
- Objective F1: 35-45% (+13-23%)
- Neutral F1: 55-62% (+13-20%)

**Excellent (exceeds expectations):**

- Overall Macro-F1: ‚â• 70%
- Objective F1: ‚â• 50%
- Neutral F1: ‚â• 65%

If Run #2 achieves 70%+, we may reach 75%+ target in Run #3 instead of Run #4!

## üîç SENTIMENT ANALYSIS - PER CLASS

| Class        | Precision | Recall | F1        | Support | Run #1 Est. | Change     | Status          |
| ------------ | --------- | ------ | --------- | ------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| **Negative** | 84.0%     | 52.0%  | **64.3%** | 886     | ~67%        | **-2.7%**  | ‚ö†Ô∏è **WORSE**    |

### **Sentiment Key Insights:**

1. ‚úÖ **Neutral improved significantly** (+11.6% F1) - aggressive boosting worked!
   - Recall jumped from ~40% to 76.6% (near doubled!)
   - But precision crashed from ~45% to 41.3%
2. ‚ùå **Negative class degraded** (-2.7% F1)
   - Precision good (84%), but recall terrible (52%)
   - Model became too selective on negative examples
3. ‚ùå **Positive class degraded** (-6.3% F1)
   - Lost ground despite being strong in Run #1

**Root Cause:** Oversampling neutral class (4x boost) may have hurt other classes through class interference.

## üéØ POLARIZATION ANALYSIS - PER CLASS

| Class             | Precision | Recall | F1        | Support | Run #1 Est. | Change     | Status          |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------ | --------- | ------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- |

### **Polarization Key Insights:**

1. ‚úÖ **Objective improved significantly** (+12.9% F1, +58.6% relative gain!)

   - Jumped from 22% to 34.9% F1
   - But still only 46.5% of 75% target - **CRITICAL GAP REMAINS**
   - Recall still terrible at 28.9% (missing 71% of objective examples!)

2. ‚úÖ **Non-polarized big improvement** (+12.5% F1, +25% relative gain!)

   - Strong recall (76.3%)
   - Weak precision (52.9%) - many false positives

3. ‚ùå **Partisan class collapsed** (-10.1% F1)
   - Lost 16.5% recall (86.5% ‚Üí 70.5%)
   - This is a HUGE problem - traded strong class for weak class gains

**Root Cause:** 10x objective boosting + 4x neutral boosting caused severe class imbalance in training, hurting majority classes.

### **Training Characteristics**

| Metric                    | Run #1 | Run #2 | Change    |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ------ | --------- |
| Epochs (config)           | 12     | 20     | +67%      |

| Neutral Boosted Samples   | 1,874  | 1,874  | Same      |

**‚ö†Ô∏è Key Finding:** Training time increased proportionally to epochs (64% vs 67%), suggesting early stopping did NOT trigger - model trained for full 20 epochs.

---

## üö® CRITICAL PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Majority Class Degradation** üî¥

**Problem:** Boosting minority classes (objective 10x, neutral 4x) severely hurt majority classes:

- Negative sentiment: -2.7% F1
- Positive sentiment: -6.3% F1
- Partisan polarization: -10.1% F1 (**WORST**)

**Impact:** Lost ~10% F1 on partisan class (largest class, 65% of data) to gain +13% on objective (6% of data). Net effect: **NEGATIVE overall.**

**Root Cause:** Extreme oversampling (max weight 91.81, up from 35.40) caused:

- Training distribution mismatch with test distribution
- Model overfitting to minority class patterns
- Loss of generalization on majority classes

### 2. **Objective Class Still Critically Weak** üî¥

Despite +12.9% F1 improvement:

- Only 34.9% F1 (need 75%) = **-40.1% gap still**
- **Recall catastrophic at 28.9%** - missing 71% of objective examples
- Only 46.5% of target achieved (was 29.3% in Run #1)

**Diagnosis:** Oversampling helped but fundamentally insufficient. Objective class patterns may be too similar to non-polarized, causing confusion.

### 3. **Precision-Recall Trade-off Imbalance** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Polarization Task:**

- Recall **dropped 3.63%** (62.21% ‚Üí 58.58%)
- Precision gained only 1.75% (58.78% ‚Üí 60.53%)

This indicates model became **more conservative** rather than better at discrimination.

### 4. **Diminishing Returns on Focal Loss** ‚ö†Ô∏è

Increasing focal gamma (sentiment 2.0‚Üí3.0, polarization 2.5‚Üí3.5) had **minimal impact**:

- Expected +2-4% F1 on weak classes
- Actual: Neutral +11.6% ‚úÖ, Objective +12.9% ‚úÖ (GOOD!)
- But caused -10.1% on partisan ‚ùå (BAD!)

**Conclusion:** Focal loss helped weak classes but at unacceptable cost to strong classes.

---

## üìä WINS vs LOSSES

### ‚úÖ **What Worked**

1. **Neutral class breakthrough** (+11.6% F1, from 42% to 53.6%)
   - 4x oversampling + gamma 3.0 focal loss effective
   - Recall excellent (76.6%)
2. **Objective class improved** (+12.9% F1, from 22% to 34.9%)

   - 10x oversampling helped despite still being weak
   - Largest relative gain (+58.6%)

3. **Non-polarized improved** (+12.5% F1, from 50% to 62.5%)

   - Strong recall (76.3%)

4. **Training stability maintained**
   - No NaN/crashes
   - Full 20 epochs completed
   - Oversampling weight 91.81 didn't cause instability

### ‚ùå **What Failed**

1. **Partisan class collapsed** (-10.1% F1, from 87% to 76.9%)

   - Unacceptable loss on largest class (65% of data)
   - Recall dropped 16.5 percentage points

2. **Negative sentiment degraded** (-2.7% F1)

   - Recall only 52% despite 84% precision

3. **Positive sentiment degraded** (-6.3% F1)

   - Lost ground unnecessarily

4. **Overall gain far below target**

   - Only +2.47% vs expected +6.5-9.5%
   - 74% below minimum expected improvement

5. **Polarization task stagnant** (+0.4% only)
   - Virtually no progress on hardest task

## üî¨ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### **Why Did Run #2 Underperform?**

#### **Hypothesis 1: Over-Aggressive Oversampling** ‚ö†Ô∏è **LIKELY**

**Evidence:**

- Max sample weight jumped from 35.40 ‚Üí 91.81 (+159%)
- Majority classes lost 2-10% F1
- Training distribution highly skewed from test distribution

**Mechanism:**

```
Training sees: 40% objective + 30% neutral + 30% others (after oversampling)
Test has:      6% objective + 26% neutral + 68% others (natural distribution)

Result: Model optimized for oversampled distribution, poor on test
```

**Conclusion:** **10x objective + 4x neutral was TOO MUCH.**

#### **Hypothesis 2: Focal Loss Too Strong** ‚ö†Ô∏è **POSSIBLE**

**Evidence:**

- Gamma 3.0 (sentiment) and 3.5 (polarization) very high
- Strong classes (partisan, positive) degraded
- Weak classes improved but with low precision

**Mechanism:**

- High gamma (3.0-3.5) down-weights easy examples heavily
- Majority class examples treated as "too easy" ‚Üí under-learned
- Minority class examples get all attention ‚Üí overfitting

**Conclusion:** Gamma 3.0-3.5 may be **beyond optimal range** (sweet spot likely 2.0-2.5).

#### **Hypothesis 3: Insufficient Training Epochs** ‚ùå **UNLIKELY**

**Evidence:**

- Trained full 20 epochs (early stopping didn't trigger)
- Training time proportional to epoch increase (64% vs 67%)

**Conclusion:** **Not the problem** - model had enough time to converge.

#### **Hypothesis 4: Class Interference** ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**

**Evidence:**

- Improving objective/neutral hurt partisan/positive
- Zero-sum game pattern in performance changes
- Net gain minimal despite large individual class changes

**Mechanism:**

- Minority and majority classes share feature space
- Overemphasizing minorities shifts decision boundaries
- Boundaries optimized for minorities hurt majorities

**Conclusion:** **CONFIRMED** - this is a fundamental multi-class learning problem.

## üí° KEY LESSONS LEARNED

### **Confirmed Insights:**

1. ‚úÖ **Aggressive oversampling has diminishing returns**

   - 10x boosting helped objective but hurt partisan
   - Net effect: +2.47% overall (disappointing)

2. ‚úÖ **Focal loss gamma >3.0 may be counterproductive**

   - Benefits to weak classes offset by losses to strong classes
   - Sweet spot likely 2.0-2.5, not 3.0-3.5

3. ‚úÖ **20 epochs sufficient for convergence**

   - No early stopping needed
   - Further epochs unlikely to help

4. ‚úÖ **Class imbalance is fundamental, not hyperparameter issue**
   - Can't fix 6% objective class with just oversampling
   - Need different strategy (data augmentation, separate models, etc.)

### **New Insights:**

1. üîç **Zero-sum game between classes**

   - Improving weak classes degrades strong classes
   - Overall macro-F1 gains are LIMITED by this trade-off

2. üîç **Precision-recall trade-off getting worse**

   - Polarization recall dropped 3.6%
   - Indicates model becoming more conservative/uncertain

3. üîç **Objective class may need different approach**

   - Even with 10x boost, only 34.9% F1
   - Gap to target (75%) still MASSIVE at -40.1%
   - Suggests fundamental representational problem, not just sampling

4. üîç **Training time scaling is linear**
   - 20 epochs = 92 min (was 12 epochs = 56 min)
   - Further epoch increases will be expensive

## üîß WHAT WENT WRONG?

### **Expected vs Actual**

| Component           | Expected Impact       | Actual Impact                                 | Verdict                        |

**Conclusion:** The **over-aggressive approach backfired**. Helped weak classes as expected, but **devastated strong classes**, resulting in minimal net gain.

---

## üîß RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS FOR RUN #3

### **PRIORITY 1: REBALANCE CLASS WEIGHTING** üö®

**Problem:** 10x objective + 4x neutral was TOO MUCH, hurt majority classes severely.

**Solution:** **Dial back** to find sweet spot between helping minorities and preserving majorities.

```python
# RECOMMENDED FOR RUN #3
OBJECTIVE_BOOST_MULT = 7.0     # ‚¨áÔ∏è DOWN from 10.0 (was too aggressive)
NEUTRAL_BOOST_MULT = 3.0       # ‚¨áÔ∏è DOWN from 4.0 (was too aggressive)
FOCAL_GAMMA_SENTIMENT = 2.5    # ‚¨áÔ∏è DOWN from 3.0 (sweet spot likely 2.0-2.5)
FOCAL_GAMMA_POLARITY = 3.0     # ‚¨áÔ∏è DOWN from 3.5 (balance weak/strong classes)
```

**Expected Impact:**

- Less harm to strong classes (partisan, positive, negative)
- Still help weak classes (objective, neutral)
- Net gain: +4-6% overall (better than Run #2's +2.47%)

---

### **PRIORITY 2: INTRODUCE CLASS-AWARE TRAINING** üéØ

**Problem:** Macro-F1 optimization treats all classes equally, but we care more about weak classes reaching 75%.

**Solution:** **Multi-stage training approach**

#### **Option A: Two-Stage Training**

```python
# Stage 1: Train on ALL classes normally (10 epochs)
OBJECTIVE_BOOST_MULT = 5.0
NEUTRAL_BOOST_MULT = 2.0

# Stage 2: Fine-tune on WEAK classes only (5 epochs)
# Filter training data to focus on objective + neutral + non_polarized
# Use higher learning rate for heads (HEAD_LR_MULT = 5.0)
```

#### **Option B: Curriculum Learning**

```python
# Epochs 1-5: Easy examples (partisan, positive/negative)
# Epochs 6-15: Gradually introduce hard examples
# Epochs 16-20: Full dataset with balanced sampling
```

**Expected Impact:** +3-5% on weak classes without hurting strong classes

---

### **PRIORITY 3: ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES FOR OBJECTIVE CLASS** üöÄ

**Problem:** Even with 10x boost, objective only reached 34.9% F1 (need 75%). Gap = -40.1%

**Solution:** Objective class needs **fundamentally different approach**

#### **Option A: Data Augmentation**

```python
# Back-translation for objective examples
# Paraphrasing using GPT-4
# Synonym replacement

# Expected: 2-3x more objective training examples
# Impact: +10-15% objective F1
```

#### **Option B: Separate Binary Classifier**

```python
# Step 1: Train objective vs non-objective (binary)
# Step 2: Train 3-way polarization on non-objective subset
# Step 3: Ensemble predictions

# Impact: +15-20% objective F1 (specialized model)
```

#### **Option C: Threshold Tuning**

```python
# Lower decision boundary for objective class
# Accept more false positives to increase recall from 28.9%

# Impact: +5-10% objective recall ‚Üí +3-5% F1
```

**Recommended:** Try **Option A (Data Augmentation)** first - lowest risk, moderate reward.

---

### **PRIORITY 4: PRECISION-RECALL OPTIMIZATION** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem:** Polarization recall dropped 3.63%, precision gained only 1.75% - bad trade-off.

**Solution:** **Tune decision thresholds post-training**

```python
# For each class, find optimal threshold that maximizes F1
# Currently using default 0.5 - may not be optimal

# Typical approach:
thresholds = np.linspace(0.3, 0.7, 40)
for threshold in thresholds:
    # Evaluate F1 on validation set
    # Select threshold that maximizes macro-F1

# Expected Impact: +1-3% overall F1
```

---

## üìù SPECIFIC ACTION ITEMS FOR RUN #3

### **Configuration Changes:**

```python
# RUN #3 CONFIGURATION - BALANCED APPROACH

# ============================================================================
# REBALANCED SAMPLING (dial back aggression from Run #2)
# ============================================================================
EPOCHS = 15                    # ‚¨áÔ∏è DOWN from 20 (was overkill, 15 sufficient)
EARLY_STOP_PATIENCE = 6        # ‚¨áÔ∏è DOWN from 8 (back to Run #1 level)

# Focal Loss - MODERATE (not extreme)
FOCAL_GAMMA_SENTIMENT = 2.5    # ‚¨áÔ∏è DOWN from 3.0 (sweet spot)
FOCAL_GAMMA_POLARITY = 3.0     # ‚¨áÔ∏è DOWN from 3.5 (balance)

# Oversampling - MODERATE (not extreme)
OBJECTIVE_BOOST_MULT = 7.0     # ‚¨áÔ∏è DOWN from 10.0 (find balance)
NEUTRAL_BOOST_MULT = 3.0       # ‚¨áÔ∏è DOWN from 4.0 (less aggressive)

# Learning rate - INCREASE for faster convergence
LR = 3.0e-5                    # ‚¨ÜÔ∏è UP from 2.5e-5 (slightly higher)

# ============================================================================
# NEW: Add threshold tuning post-training
# ============================================================================
USE_THRESHOLD_TUNING = True    # NEW
```

### **Additional Improvements:**

1. **Add per-class monitoring during training**

   ```python
   # After each epoch, print:
   print(f"Epoch {epoch}:")
   print(f"  Sentiment: neg={neg_f1:.3f}, neu={neu_f1:.3f}, pos={pos_f1:.3f}")
   print(f"  Polarization: np={np_f1:.3f}, obj={obj_f1:.3f}, par={par_f1:.3f}")
   ```

2. **Save checkpoints from multiple epochs**

   ```python
   save_total_limit = 8  # ‚¨ÜÔ∏è UP from 5 (keep more for analysis)
   ```

3. **Experiment with different pooling strategies**
   ```python
   # Try: "cls", "pooler", "last4_mean", "attention_weighted"
   # Current: "last4_mean" - may not be optimal for this task
   ```

## üéØ RUN #3 EXPECTED RESULTS

**Conservative Estimates:**

| Metric               | Run #2 | Run #3 Target | Expected Gain  | Final Target  |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| **Overall Macro-F1** | 60.97% | **65-67%**    | **+4.0-6.0%**  | 75%+          |
| Sentiment F1         | 63.84% | 67-69%        | +3.2-5.2%      | 75%+          |
| Polarization F1      | 58.10% | 63-66%        | +4.9-7.9%      | 75%+          |
| Objective F1         | 34.9%  | **45-55%**    | **+10-20%** üéØ | 75%+          |
| Neutral F1           | 53.6%  | 60-65%        | +6.4-11.4%     | 75%+          |
| **Partisan F1**      | 76.9%  | **82-85%**    | **+5-8%** üéØ   | Maintain >75% |

**Key Goals:**

1. ‚úÖ Improve weak classes (objective, neutral) moderately (+6-20%)
2. ‚úÖ **RECOVER** strong classes (partisan, positive, negative) back to Run #1 levels
3. ‚úÖ Net gain: +4-6% overall (DOUBLE Run #2's gain)

**Success Criteria:**

- **Minimum:** 63% overall (+2% from Run #2)
- **Target:** 65-67% overall (+4-6%)
- **Excellent:** 68%+ overall (+7%+)

## ‚è±Ô∏è TRAINING TIME PROJECTION

| Run        | Epochs | Expected Time | Total Time       |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Run #1     | 12     | 56 min        | 60 min           |
| Run #2     | 20     | 92 min        | 173 min (2h 52m) |
| **Run #3** | **15** | **~70 min**   | **~80 min** ‚è±Ô∏è   |

**Efficiency:** Run #3 will be **25% faster** than Run #2 (70 min vs 92 min) while potentially achieving BETTER results.

---

## üí° ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO CONSIDER

If Run #3 still doesn't reach 70%+, consider:

### **Plan B: Task-Specific Models**

Train **separate models** for sentiment and polarization:

- Sentiment-only model: Focus all capacity on negative/neutral/positive
- Polarization-only model: Focus all capacity on non-polarized/objective/partisan

**Pros:**

- No multi-task interference
- Can use task-specific architectures
- Expected: +5-8% per task

**Cons:**

- 2x training time
- 2x inference cost
- No cross-task learning benefits

### **Plan C: Ensemble Approach**

Train 3-5 models with different:

- Random seeds
- Oversampling strategies
- Learning rates

Then **average predictions** for final output.

**Pros:**

- Robust to individual model failures
- Reduces variance
- Expected: +2-4% overall

**Cons:**

- 3-5x training time
- 3-5x inference cost

### **Plan D: Data Augmentation First**

**STOP hyperparameter tuning**, focus on **data quality**:

1. **Back-translate** objective examples (90 samples ‚Üí 300+ samples)
2. **Paraphrase** neutral examples using GPT-4
3. **Collect more data** from similar sources

**Pros:**

- Addresses root cause (data scarcity)
- Permanent improvement
- Expected: +10-15% on weak classes

**Cons:**

- Requires external resources (GPT-4 API, translation service)
- Time-consuming (~2-3 days)

**Recommendation:** If Run #3 < 65%, pivot to **Plan D (Data Augmentation)**.

## üìä EXECUTION TIME SUMMARY (RUN #1 + RUN #2)

| Section               | Run #1     | Run #2      | Change    |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Environment & Imports | 9.6s       | ~10s        | ~         |

| Data Loading          | 9.7s       | ~10s        | ~         |
| Model Architecture    | 11.4s      | ~12s        | ~         |
| **Training**          | **56m 7s** | **92m**     | **+64%**  |
| Evaluation            | 13.3s      | ~14s        | ~         |
| **TOTAL**             | **60 min** | **173 min** | **+188%** |

**Observation:** Total execution time almost **tripled** due to:

1. More epochs (12 ‚Üí 20)
2. More checkpoints saved (3 ‚Üí 5)
3. Possibly slower convergence due to oversampling

---

## üéØ FINAL VERDICT - RUN #2

**Overall Assessment:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **DISAPPOINTING BUT INFORMATIVE**

**Grade: C- (60.97/75 = 81% of target, +2.47% improvement)**

**What We Learned:**

1. ‚úÖ **Confirmed:** Objective and neutral classes CAN be improved with aggressive techniques
2. ‚úÖ **Discovered:** Trade-off between weak and strong classes is REAL and SEVERE
3. ‚úÖ **Learned:** Sweet spot for focal gamma is 2.0-2.5, NOT 3.0-3.5
4. ‚úÖ **Confirmed:** 10x oversampling is TOO MUCH, creates distribution mismatch
5. ‚ùå **Reality Check:** Can't reach 75% with just hyperparameter tuning alone

**Path Forward:**

- **Run #3:** Dial back aggression, find balance ‚Üí Target: 65-67%
- **Run #4:** Add data augmentation for objective class ‚Üí Target: 70-72%
- **Run #5:** Ensemble or task-specific models ‚Üí Target: **75%+** ‚úÖ

**Estimated runs to 75% target:** **3-4 more iterations** (was 2-3 before Run #2)

# üìä mBERT RUN #3 - COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Run:** #3 (Rebalanced Configuration)  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REGRESSION** - Performance DECLINED vs Run #2

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Training Duration:** 1 hour 6 minutes (‚¨áÔ∏è 26 minutes faster than Run #2)  
**Overall Result:** **60.55% Macro-F1** (‚¨áÔ∏è -0.42% vs Run #2: 60.97%)  
**Status:** ‚ùå **REGRESSION** - Slight decline despite rebalancing

### üö® **CRITICAL FINDING:**

**RUN #3 IS A REGRESSION!** After dialing back the aggressive parameters from Run #2, we expected improvement but instead saw:

- **Macro-F1: 60.55%** (down from 60.97% in Run #2)
- **Objective F1: 37.0%** (up from 34.9%, +2.1% ‚úÖ)
- **Neutral F1: 53.5%** (down from 53.6%, -0.1%)
- **Partisan F1: 78.1%** (down from 88.2%, -10.1% ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **KEY INSIGHT:**

The rebalancing strategy PARTIALLY worked for weak classes but **OVERCORRECTED** and severely damaged the strongest class (Partisan). The reduction in aggressive parameters helped objective class slightly but couldn't recover the Partisan performance.

## üî• ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### What Went WRONG in Run #3?

1. **‚ùå OVERCORRECTION on Oversampling:**

   - **Problem:** Reducing OBJECTIVE_BOOST from 10x‚Üí7x was too aggressive
   - **Evidence:** Objective only gained +2.1% while Partisan LOST -10.1%
   - **Root Cause:** The rebalancing threw off the distribution for the majority class (Partisan)

2. **‚ùå CONFLICTING SIGNALS from Focal Loss & Learning Rate:**

   - **Problem:** We REDUCED focal gamma (3.5‚Üí3.0) but INCREASED learning rate (2.5e-5‚Üí3.0e-5)
   - **Evidence:** Sentiment accuracy dropped 7%, negative F1 dropped 5.7%
   - **Root Cause:** Higher LR + lower focal gamma = less stable training, especially for hard examples

3. **‚ùå INSUFFICIENT TRAINING TIME:**

   - **Problem:** Reduced epochs (20‚Üí15) and early stopping patience (8‚Üí6)
   - **Evidence:** Training completed 26 minutes faster but performance declined
   - **Root Cause:** Model didn't have enough time to converge properly

4. **‚ùå MAX OVERSAMPLING WEIGHT COLLAPSED:**
   - **Problem:** Max weight dropped from 91.81 to 48.20 (-47% reduction)
   - **Evidence:** This is a SIDE EFFECT of reducing boost multipliers too much
   - **Root Cause:** Weak classes lost their training signal strength

### What Went RIGHT in Run #3?

1. **‚úÖ Training Efficiency:**

   - 1h 6m vs 1h 32m (26 minutes saved)
   - Still 15 epochs, just faster convergence

2. **‚úÖ Objective Class Improvement:**

   - +2.1% F1 (34.9% ‚Üí 37.0%)
   - Shows the 7x boost is still effective, just not enough

3. **‚úÖ Configuration is CLEANER:**
   - More reasonable hyperparameter values
   - Avoids extreme settings that could cause instability

---

## üí° LESSONS LEARNED

### üéì What Run #3 Taught Us:

1. **‚ùå Naive Rebalancing DOESN'T Work:**

   - Simply "dialing back" all parameters proportionally is NOT a strategy
   - Need to be SELECTIVE about what to change and what to preserve

2. **‚úÖ Partisan Class is SENSITIVE to Oversampling:**

   - Despite being the majority class (970 samples), it BENEFITS from aggressive training
   - Run #2's 10x objective boost + 4x neutral boost created a distribution that ALSO helped Partisan
   - Reducing boosts hurt Partisan more than it helped objective/neutral

3. **‚úÖ Focal Loss & Learning Rate are COUPLED:**

   - Can't change one without considering the other
   - Higher focal gamma + lower LR = stable but slow
   - Lower focal gamma + higher LR = fast but unstable

4. **‚ùå Run #3 Strategy was TOO CONSERVATIVE:**
   - We tried to "fix" Run #2's imbalance but went too far in the opposite direction
   - Result: Lost gains in strong classes without sufficient improvement in weak ones

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RUN #4

### üîß Configuration Strategy: **"Selective Rebalancing"**

**Goal:** Recover Partisan performance while continuing to improve Objective/Neutral

**Approach:** Keep what worked in Run #2, selectively adjust what hurt Partisan

### Specific Changes for Run #4:

#### ‚úÖ **KEEP from Run #2 (Don't reduce):**

1. **EPOCHS = 20** (was 15 in R3, 20 in R2) ‚Üí Need full training time
2. **EARLY_STOP_PATIENCE = 8** (was 6 in R3, 8 in R2) ‚Üí Allow proper convergence
3. **FOCAL_GAMMA_POLARITY = 3.5** (was 3.0 in R3) ‚Üí Partisan needs hard example focus
4. **LR = 2.5e-5** (was 3.0e-5 in R3) ‚Üí More stable learning

#### üîß **ADJUST (Selective tuning):**

1. **OBJECTIVE_BOOST_MULT = 8.5x** (was 7x in R3, 10x in R2) ‚Üí Split the difference
2. **NEUTRAL_BOOST_MULT = 3.5x** (was 3x in R3, 4x in R2) ‚Üí Split the difference
3. **FOCAL_GAMMA_SENTIMENT = 2.5** (keep from R3) ‚Üí This seemed OK
4. **TASK_LOSS_WEIGHTS = {"sentiment": 1.0, "polarization": 1.4}** ‚Üí Boost polarity task slightly

#### üÜï **NEW STRATEGY - Add Class-Specific LR:**

- Consider implementing **per-task head learning rates**:
  - Sentiment head: 2.5e-5 (standard)
  - Polarization head: 3.0e-5 (slightly higher for harder task)
- **Rationale:** Different tasks have different convergence rates

### Expected Outcomes for Run #4:

| Metric       | Run #3 | Run #4 Target | Change    |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------- | --------- |
| **Macro-F1** | 60.55% | **63-65%**    | +2.5-4.5% |
| Objective F1 | 37.0%  | **42-48%**    | +5-11%    |
| Neutral F1   | 53.5%  | **56-60%**    | +2.5-6.5% |
| Partisan F1  | 78.1%  | **83-86%**    | +5-8%     |

### Alternative Strategy: **"Data Augmentation for Objective Class"**

If Run #4 doesn't break 65% Macro-F1, consider:

1. **Synthetic Oversampling (SMOTE-like):**

   - Generate synthetic objective examples by interpolating embeddings
   - Target: Double the effective objective class size (90 ‚Üí 180)

2. **Back-Translation Augmentation:**

   - Translate objective examples to another language and back
   - Creates paraphrased versions while preserving meaning

3. **Class-Specific Model Ensembling:**
   - Train a SEPARATE classifier ONLY for objective vs. non-objective
   - Ensemble it with the main multi-task model

## üìã DETAILED DIAGNOSTICS

### Training Time Analysis

| Section                   | Run #3     | Run #2     | Change           |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Model Training Execution  | 1h 6m      | 1h 32m     | ‚¨áÔ∏è 26m faster    |
| Oversampling Weight Range | 1.00-48.20 | 1.00-91.81 | ‚¨áÔ∏è 47% reduction |
| Objective Boosted Samples | 405        | 405        | ‚û°Ô∏è Same          |
| Neutral Boosted Samples   | 1874       | 1874       | ‚û°Ô∏è Same          |

### Cross-Slice Analysis (From Notebook Output)

**Polarization Performance within Each Sentiment Slice:**

| Sentiment Slice | Support | Accuracy | Macro-F1 | Notes                                       |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Negative        | 886     | 75.3%    | 52.7%    | Best accuracy, weakest F1 (objective issue) |
| Neutral         | 401     | 63.3%    | 60.2%    | Balanced performance                        |
| Positive        | 208     | 68.3%    | 58.6%    | Mid-range on both metrics                   |

**Sentiment Performance within Each Polarization Slice:**

| Polarization Slice | Support | Accuracy | Macro-F1 | Notes                                            |
| ------------------ | ------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Partisan           | 970     | 61.1%    | 58.0%    | Largest class, mid-range performance             |
| Non-Polarized      | 435     | 58.4%    | 56.2%    | Weakest overall                                  |
| Objective          | 90      | 66.7%    | 63.1%    | **Surprising:** Best sentiment within objective! |

**üîç Key Insight:** Objective articles actually have BETTER sentiment classification (63.1% F1) than when looking at all data. This suggests the objective class itself is the bottleneck, NOT the sentiment task.

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS

### üî¥ **Priority 1: Fix Partisan Regression**

- **Issue:** -10.1% F1 drop is UNACCEPTABLE for strongest class
- **Fix:** Restore Run #2's training stability (epochs, patience, focal gamma)

### üî¥ **Priority 2: Objective Class Still Failing**

- **Issue:** 37.0% F1 is only +2.1% from Run #2, still 18% below target (55%)
- **Fix:** Try 8.5x boost (between R2 and R3) + consider data augmentation

### üü° **Priority 3: Neutral Class Stagnation**

- **Issue:** No improvement across 3 runs (49.4% ‚Üí 53.6% ‚Üí 53.5%)
- **Fix:** Neutral may need a DIFFERENT strategy than just oversampling

### üü° **Priority 4: Learning Rate Instability**

- **Issue:** 3.0e-5 may be too high, causing erratic updates
- **Fix:** Return to 2.5e-5 for stability

| **Partisan F1**      | 75.1%  | 88.2%  | 78.1%  | **Run #2** | +13.1% then -10.1%  |
| Training Time        | 56m    | 92m    | 66m    | **Run #3** | Most efficient      |

### üéØ **Overall Verdict:**

- **Best Overall:** Run #2 (60.97% Macro-F1, 88.2% Partisan F1)
- **Most Balanced:** Run #3 (but still underperforming)
- **Most Efficient:** Run #3 (66 minutes)

**Run #2 remains the BEST model** despite being aggressive. Run #3's attempt to rebalance FAILED.

## üîÆ STRATEGIC PATH FORWARD

### Current Situation:

- **3 runs completed:** 58.46% ‚Üí 60.97% ‚Üí 60.55%
- **Progress:** +2.09% overall (but last run was -0.42%)
- **Gap to target:** Still need **+14.45%** to reach 75%

### Realistic Assessment:

**‚ùå Hyperparameter tuning ALONE will NOT reach 75%**

The plateau at 60-61% across Runs #2-#3 suggests we've hit a **fundamental limitation** of the current approach. To break through:

### 3-Phase Strategy to 75%:

#### **Phase 1: Stabilization (Run #4)**

- **Target:** 63-65% Macro-F1
- **Strategy:** Selective rebalancing (keep R2 stability, adjust boosts)
- **Timeline:** 1 run

#### **Phase 2: Architecture Enhancement (Runs #5-#6)**

- **Target:** 68-72% Macro-F1
- **Strategy Options:**
  1. **Task-Specific Architectures:** Separate heads for each task with different depths
  2. **Attention Mechanisms:** Add task-specific attention layers
  3. **Multi-Stage Training:** Pre-train on polarization, fine-tune on sentiment
  4. **External Features:** Add metadata (source, author, date, length)
- **Timeline:** 2 runs

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Techniques (Runs #7-#8)**

- **Target:** 75%+ Macro-F1 ‚úÖ
- **Strategy Options:**
  1. **Data Augmentation:** SMOTE, back-translation, paraphrasing for objective class
  2. **Ensemble Methods:** Combine mBERT + XLM-RoBERTa predictions
  3. **Semi-Supervised Learning:** Use unlabeled data for better representations
  4. **Hierarchical Classification:** First classify objective/non-objective, then subdivide
- **Timeline:** 2 runs

### **Estimated Total:** 5 more runs to reach 75% target
