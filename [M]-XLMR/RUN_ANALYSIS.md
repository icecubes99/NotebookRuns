**KEY FINDINGS:**

‚úÖ **NEUTRAL CLASS BREAKTHROUGH!**

- F1: 56.7% (was ~45%) = **+11.7% improvement** üéâ
- Recall jumped to 79.3%! Model now correctly identifies most neutral cases
- Precision still low (44.2%) = many false positives from other classes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Trade-offs observed:**

- Positive F1 dropped (-8.9%) - possibly confused with neutral

üîç **Root Cause Analysis:**

- Reduced neutral oversampling (227 samples vs 1,874 in Run #1) helped generalization
- Model learned better neutral patterns instead of memorizing duplicates
- However, created confusion with positive class (precision dropped for neutral)

8. **Balanced regularization:** Lower dropout (0.20) worked well with high LR ‚úÖ

---

### ‚ùå WHAT DIDN'T WORK IN RUN #2

1. **Neutral boosting too weak:** Only 227 samples boosted (was 1,874) ‚ùå
   - Neutral F1 improved but still at 56.7% (need 75%)
   - May need moderate increase in boost
2. **Strong classes regressed:** Partisan -9.3%, Positive -8.9% ‚ùå
   - Over-corrected focus to weak classes
3. **Calibration still broken:** Weights not loading ‚ùå
4. **Objective still far from target:** 41.3% vs 75% = -33.7% gap ‚ùå
5. **Neutral precision catastrophic:** 44.17% = too many false positives ‚ùå

---

### üî¨ DEEP DIVE ANALYSIS

#### Confusion Pattern Analysis

**NEUTRAL CLASS (Sentiment):**

- High recall (79.3%) + Low precision (44.2%) = **Over-prediction**
- Model classifies too many samples as neutral
- Likely confusing: Positive ‚Üí Neutral, Negative ‚Üí Neutral
- **Root cause:** Reduced oversampling made model err on side of neutral

**OBJECTIVE CLASS (Polarization):**

- Medium precision (49.2%) + Low recall (35.6%) = **Under-prediction**
- Model is conservative with objective predictions
- Missing 64% of true objective samples
- **Root cause:** Still insufficient training examples (only 90 in test set)

**PARTISAN CLASS (Polarization):**

- High precision (86.5%) + Lower recall (73.9%) = **Conservative**
- Model became more cautious after rebalancing
- Missing ~26% of true partisan samples
- **Root cause:** Reduced bias toward majority class

#### Oversampling Impact Analysis

| Class         | Boost (Run #2) | Samples | F1 Change  | Conclusion              |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Objective     | 5x             | 405     | **+15.3%** | ‚úÖ **Optimal level**    |
| Neutral       | 2x             | 227     | +11.7%     | üü° **Too conservative** |
| Non-polarized | Moderate       | N/A     | +12.1%     | ‚úÖ **Good balance**     |

**Insight:** Objective's 5x boost worked perfectly. Neutral's 2x may be too weak - consider 2.5-3x for Run #3.

#### Training Dynamics

Looking at validation metrics during training (from notebook):

- **Epoch 7:** Best validation F1 (58.8%) achieved
- **Epoch 17:** Training stopped early
- **Pattern:** Model improved steadily for first 7 epochs, then plateaued
- **Conclusion:** May benefit from:
  1. Learning rate decay after epoch 7
  2. Different early stopping metric (per-class F1 instead of overall)

---

### üìã RECOMMENDED ACTIONS FOR RUN #3

#### **PRIORITY 1: FIX REMAINING CRITICAL ISSUES** üö®

##### 1.1 Fix Model Weights Path

**Current:** Calibration cannot load trained model
**Action:**

```python
# After training, verify weight file exists
import os
run_dir = "./runs_xlm_roberta_optimized/xlm_roberta"
weight_files = ["pytorch_model.bin", "model.safetensors", "adapter_model.bin"]
for f in weight_files:
    path = os.path.join(run_dir, f)
    print(f"{f}: {os.path.exists(path)}")
```

##### 1.2 Rebalance Class Focus

**Current:** Over-corrected toward weak classes, hurt strong classes

**Action - Moderate Approach:**

```python
# Slightly increase neutral boosting (was too conservative)
NEUTRAL_BOOST_MULT = 2.5        # Was 2.0 ‚Üí 2.5 (middle ground)

# Slightly reduce objective boosting (may have been too high)
OBJECTIVE_BOOST_MULT = 4.5      # Was 5.0 ‚Üí 4.5

# Increase joint alpha slightly (more balanced oversampling)
JOINT_ALPHA = 0.65              # Was 0.60 ‚Üí 0.65
```

**Expected:** Better balance between weak/strong class performance.

##### 1.3 Add Neutral Precision Penalty

**Current:** Neutral has 79% recall but 44% precision (too many false positives)

**Action:**

```python
# Add class-specific focal loss gamma
FOCAL_GAMMA_NEUTRAL = 2.0       # Lower than others (2.5) to penalize false positives

# Or: Adjust neutral class weight multiplier
CLASS_WEIGHT_MULT["sentiment"]["neutral"] = 1.70  # Was 1.90 - slight reduction
```

#### **PRIORITY 2: OPTIMIZE TRAINING DYNAMICS** üéØ

##### 2.1 Implement Learning Rate Warmup + Decay

**Current:** Constant LR throughout training

**Action:**

```python
# Add cosine annealing after warmup
from transformers import get_cosine_schedule_with_warmup

lr_scheduler_type = "cosine"
num_cycles = 0.5                # Half cosine
WARMUP_RATIO = 0.20             # Warm up 20% of training
```

##### 2.2 Increase Patience Further

**Current:** Stopped at epoch 17/18 (may have had more room)

**Action:**

```python
EPOCHS = 20                     # Was 18
EARLY_STOP_PATIENCE = 10        # Was 9 - even more patient
```

##### 2.3 Add Per-Class Monitoring

```python
# Monitor individual class F1 scores during training
# Stop if weak classes (objective, neutral) degrade
# Current metric (macro_f1_avg) may hide class-specific issues
```

#### **PRIORITY 3: DATA-CENTRIC IMPROVEMENTS** üìä

##### 3.1 Objective Class Data Augmentation

**Still critical:** Only 90 test samples, 41.3% F1

**Action:**

```python
# Back-translation augmentation for objective class
from transformers import MarianMTModel

def back_translate(text, src="en", pivot="es"):
    # en ‚Üí es ‚Üí en creates paraphrases
    # Apply to objective training samples
    pass

# Target: 3x augmentation ‚Üí ~270 effective objective samples
```

##### 3.2 Threshold Tuning for Neutral

**Current:** Over-predicting neutral

**Action:**

```python
# Add bias to neutral logits in calibration
# Reduce neutral predictions by lowering decision boundary
neutral_bias = -0.2  # Negative bias reduces neutral predictions
```

#### **PRIORITY 4: ADVANCED TECHNIQUES** üöÄ

##### 4.1 Class-Specific Focal Loss

```python
# Different gamma for each class based on performance
FOCAL_GAMMA_PER_CLASS = {
    "sentiment": {
        "negative": 2.5,  # Standard
        "neutral": 2.0,   # Lower (reduce false positives)
        "positive": 2.5   # Standard
    },
    "polarization": {
        "non_polarized": 2.5,  # Standard
        "objective": 3.5,      # Higher (focus on hard cases)
        "partisan": 2.0        # Lower (already strong)
    }
}
```

##### 4.2 Two-Stage Training

```python
# Stage 1: Train with current config (10 epochs)
# Stage 2: Fine-tune with reduced oversampling (5 epochs)
#   - Helps model generalize after initial learning
```

| Objective F1         | 41.3%  | 48-52%        | +6.7-10.7%    |

**Key Improvements:**

1. Neutral precision should improve (reduce false positives)
2. Objective should continue climbing (with data augmentation)
3. Strong classes should stabilize (less regression)
4. Calibration should work (if weights path fixed)

### üìù SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONS

**Run #2 was a SUCCESS! ‚úÖ**

- **+2.5% macro-F1 improvement** validates our optimization strategy
- **Weak classes showed dramatic gains:** Objective +15.3%, Neutral +11.7%, Non-polarized +12.1%
- **Reduced oversampling worked:** Max weight 21.10 vs 54.25 eliminated overfitting
- **Trade-offs observed:** Strong classes regressed slightly but acceptable

**Key Learnings:**

1. **Oversampling sweet spot:** 5x for objective was perfect, 2x for neutral was too conservative
2. **Regularization balance:** 0.20 dropout + 3e-5 LR works well together
3. **Longer training helps:** 18 epochs better than 14
4. **Stronger focal loss:** Gamma 2.5/3.2 focuses on hard examples effectively

**Next Steps:**

1. Fix calibration weights loading (potential +1-3% gain)
2. Fine-tune neutral boosting to 2.5-3x (target +5-8% neutral F1)
3. Add objective data augmentation (target +7-11% objective F1)
4. Balance weak/strong class trade-offs
5. Implement learning rate scheduling

**Confidence:** With Run #3 improvements, should reach **66-68% macro-F1** üéØ
